# Project Governance & Community Principles

CrossPoint Reader is a community-driven, open-source project. Our goal is to provide a high-quality, open-source
firmware alternative for the Xteink X4 hardware. To keep this project productive and welcoming as we grow, we ask all
contributors to follow these principles.

### 1. The "Human First" Rule
Technical discussions can get heated, but they should never be personal.
- **Assume good intent:** We are all volunteers working on this in our free time. If a comment seems abrasive, assume
  it’s a language barrier or a misunderstanding before taking offense.
- **Focus on the code, not the person:** Critique the implementation, the performance, or the UX. Never the intelligence
  or character of the contributor.
- **Inflammatory language:** Personal attacks, trolling, or exclusionary language (based on race, gender, background,
  etc.) are not welcome here and will be moderated.

### 2. A "Do-ocracy" with Guidance
CrossPoint thrives because people step up to build what they want to see.
- If you want a feature, the best way to get it is to start an
  [Idea Discussion](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/discussions/categories/ideas) or open a PR.
- If you want to report a bug, check for duplicates and create an
  [Issue](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader/issues).
- While we encourage experimentation, the maintainers reserve the right to guide the project’s technical direction to
  ensure stability on the ESP32-C3’s constrained hardware.
- For more guidance on the scope of the project, see the [SCOPE.md](SCOPE.md) document.

### 3. Transparent Communication
To keep the project healthy, we keep our "work" in the open.
- **Public by Default:** All technical decisions and project management discussions happen in GitHub Issues, Pull
  Requests, or the public Discussions tab.
- **Clarity in Writing:** Because we have a global community with different levels of English proficiency, please be as
  explicit and clear as possible in your PR descriptions and bug reports.

### 4. Moderation & Safety
The maintainers are responsible for keeping the community a safe place to contribute.
- We reserve the right to hide comments, lock threads, or block users who repeatedly violate these principles or engage
  in harassment.
- **Reporting:** If you feel you are being harassed or see behavior that is damaging the community, please reach out
  privately to @daveallie.
